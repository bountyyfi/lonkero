# Trivy ignore file for Lonkero Security Scanner
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a SECURITY SCANNER application.
# The codebase intentionally contains test payloads for vulnerability detection:
# - Test JWT tokens
# - Example API keys (Stripe, GCP, etc.)
# - Sample credentials
# - ws:// WebSocket URLs
#
# These are NOT real secrets - they are test data for scanning targets.

# Ignore secret detection in scanner modules
src/scanners/

# Ignore secret detection in form replay (contains test tokens)
src/form_replay.rs

# Ignore test and example files

SOURCE-AVAILABLE LICENSE
Version 2.1 - Effective February 15, 2026

By using, copying, or accessing this software, you agree to be bound by
the terms of this license. If you do not agree, you may not use, copy,
or access the software in any way.

DEFINITIONS

"Software" means the Lonkero vulnerability scanner source code, compiled
binaries, documentation, and any associated files distributed by
Bountyy Oy under this license.

"Output" means any data, reports, findings, scan results, or other
information generated by the Software.

"Organization" means any company, corporation, partnership, government
entity, non-profit, or other legal entity, including its subsidiaries
and affiliates.

"Commercial Purpose" means any activity intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or monetary compensation, whether direct or
indirect. This includes but is not limited to: use in a commercial
product or service, use to support paid consulting or advisory services,
use in internal operations of a for-profit Organization, and use of
Output in any deliverable provided to a third party for compensation.

"Small Organization" means an Organization with fewer than ten (10)
employees and annual gross revenue below EUR 1,000,000.

"Competing Product" means any software product or service whose primary
function is automated vulnerability scanning, web application security
testing (DAST), static application security testing (SAST), or
attack surface management, and that is offered commercially to third
parties either as standalone software, a SaaS platform, or as a core
component of a managed service. Internal scripts, tools, or automation
used solely within an Organization's own security operations do not
constitute a Competing Product.

"Commercial License" means a separate written license agreement between
the licensee and Bountyy Oy that grants additional rights beyond those
provided in this license, including the right to use the Software for
Commercial Purposes.

PERMITTED USE

1. PERSONAL USE: Individuals may view, clone, study, compile, run, and
   modify the Software for personal, non-commercial purposes.

2. EDUCATIONAL USE: Academic institutions and students may use the
   Software for educational and research purposes, provided results are
   not used for any Commercial Purpose.

3. SMALL ORGANIZATION USE: Small Organizations may use the Software for
   internal security assessments of their own infrastructure, provided
   the Output is not sold, redistributed, or included in any service
   offered to third parties.

4. COMMERCIAL LICENSE USE: Organizations that have obtained a Commercial
   License from Bountyy Oy may use the Software and its Output in
   accordance with the terms of that Commercial License, including for
   penetration testing engagements, security assessments, consulting
   services, and other professional services delivered to third parties.
   The specific scope of permitted use is defined in each Commercial
   License.

RESTRICTIONS

The following restrictions apply to all users. Where a restriction
conflicts with rights explicitly granted in a Commercial License, the
Commercial License terms govern for that licensee only.

1. COMMERCIAL USE PROHIBITED: You may not use the Software or its Output
   for any Commercial Purpose without a Commercial License from
   Bountyy Oy.

2. ORGANIZATIONAL USE REQUIRES LICENSE: Any Organization that does not
   qualify as a Small Organization must obtain a Commercial License from
   Bountyy Oy before using the Software for any purpose, whether
   internal or external, commercial or non-commercial. This applies
   regardless of which individual within the Organization operates the
   Software.

3. SERVICE USE PROHIBITED: You may not use the Software or its Output to
   provide services to third parties, whether paid or unpaid, without a
   Commercial License from Bountyy Oy. This includes but is not limited
   to: managed security services, vulnerability assessments, penetration
   testing, consulting engagements, or any "as-a-service" offering.

4. REDISTRIBUTION: You may not redistribute the Software or derivative
   works, whether in source or binary form, without express written
   permission from Bountyy Oy.

5. PROPRIETARY NOTICES: You may not remove or alter any proprietary
   notices, labels, or marks on the Software.

6. INDIRECT USE OF OUTPUT: You may not use, incorporate, reference, or
   rely on the Output of this Software as part of any paid service,
   product, report, or deliverable provided to any third party without a
   Commercial License from Bountyy Oy.

7. REVERSE ENGINEERING: You may not reverse engineer, decompile,
   disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the internal workings,
   algorithms, or architecture of the compiled Software beyond what is
   provided in the publicly available source code. You may not use
   knowledge gained from studying the source code to build, improve, or
   contribute to any Competing Product.

8. COMPETITIVE USE PROHIBITED: You may not use the Software, its source
   code, its Output, its architecture, its detection logic, its scanning
   techniques, or any knowledge derived from it to develop, enhance,
   train, or improve any Competing Product. This restriction applies
   whether the Competing Product is commercial or non-commercial, open
   source or proprietary, and survives the termination of this license.

   For clarity: Organizations that hold a Commercial License and also
   develop or maintain a Competing Product are permitted to use the
   Software as an end-user tool under their Commercial License, but may
   not incorporate, replicate, or derive from the Software's source
   code, architecture, detection logic, or scanning techniques in their
   Competing Product. Use of the Software as an end-user tool does not
   grant any right to use the Software's internals in a Competing
   Product.

9. AI AND MODEL TRAINING: You may not use the Software, its source code,
   its documentation, or its Output as training data, fine-tuning data,
   or input for any machine learning model, artificial intelligence
   system, or automated code generation tool without express written
   permission from Bountyy Oy.

10. CIRCUMVENTION: You may not use technical measures to circumvent or
    avoid the licensing requirements of this license, including but not
    limited to operating the Software through intermediaries, shell
    entities, or automated systems designed to avoid triggering license
    requirements.

Violation of any term in this license automatically and immediately
terminates your rights under it. Upon termination, you must cease all

use after termination constitutes copyright infringement under
applicable law.

The restriction in Section 8 (Competitive Use Prohibited) survives
termination of this license indefinitely.

Bountyy Oy may update the terms of this license for future releases of
the Software. Continued use of updated versions constitutes acceptance
of the updated terms. Prior versions of the Software remain governed by
the license terms in effect at the time of their release.

OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
